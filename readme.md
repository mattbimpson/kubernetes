# Kubernetes Tutorial
This guide is meant as a starting point for learning kubernetes.

I ran the project on WSL2, using MicroK8s.

Note you cannot install MicroK8s on WSL2 without having Snap working. See the following blog, specifically the "SystemD" section. This script will allow SystemD to function, elso enabling Snap functionality. https://wsl.dev/wsl2-microk8s/

This tutorial also applies for Linux & MacOS.
